Python Astroids

A recreation from scratch of the classic arcade game. I've never actually
played the real game, so have based this on seeing youtube videos and
talking to people who have played it

Game keys used are either Q for thrust, A for shoot and OP for rotation  or  Up for Thrust, Space for shoot and Left,Right for Rotate. H for hyperspace jump

The program requires PyGame and Python 3
Sound files all created by Torin Stephens

Tested and developed under PyGame 2.0.0 and Python 3.8.5
