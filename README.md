Python Asteroids

A recreation from scratch of the classic arcade game. I've never actually
played the original game, so have based this on youtube videos and
talking to people who have played it
  
Game keys used are either Q for thrust, A for shoot and OP for rotation  or  Up for Thrust, Space for shoot and Left,Right for Rotate. H for hyperspace jump

The program requires PyGame and Python 3
